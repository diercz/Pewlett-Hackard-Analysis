# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

## Purpose
In the module 7 challenge, Bobby was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees by job title and the number of employees that are eligible to participate in a new mentorship project Pewlett Hackard is working on initiating.  

## Results
There is a high number of senior staff that could be looking to retire in the near future (see image below).  More than 24,000 Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will be eligible to retire in the near future.  Pulling this data together shows that there will be a lot of high level staff members leaving in the coming years and the mentorship program will be highly valuable to the company to ensure there is no drop in productivity in the coming years.

Per the query we ran there are also many employees that will be eligible to participate in the mentorship program, totaling 1,549 current employees.  This will be a good start to ensure the continued growth of Pewlett Hackard.

From our analysis we determined the following:
- 72,458 employees are eligible to retire
- 1,549 of those employees are eligible to be a part of the mentorship program.
- The largest #'s of eligible retiring job titles include
    - Senior Engineer
    - Senior Staff
    - Engineers



## Summary
The total amount of employees eligible to retire is 72,458.  At this time it is hard to determine at what point Pewlett Hackard will feel the impact as it we are unable to determine when these employees will decide to retire.  Given the high amount of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff I would expect this to impact them greatly if they all started to retire at a given time and would advise Pewlett Hackard to start recruiting the next generation as soon as possible.

There are 1,459 employees that are eligible to be a part of the mentorship program.  This should be sufficient enough staff to help mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, given they all are willing to join the program prior to fully retiring from the company.

A few more quieries that would be benificial to pull to help with our analysis: 
- Count of employees by job title that are eligible to be a part of the mentorship program.
- Count of employees by year by job title that will be eligible to retire to understand where we need to put more focus on in the near future.
